<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This track shows DNA regions that are homologous to transposable
element (TE) proteins.  It shows alignments of the genomic DNA to
proteins from
<a href="http://www.repeatmasker.org/">RepeatMasker</a>'s database of
TE proteins.</p>

<p>It's called "all" TE proteins because it includes not only
homologies found directly in this genome, but also homologies found in
other genomes and mapped to this one via inter-genome alignments.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>The color indicates the minimum age of the TE insertion:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color:#FF0000">At least as old as the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates
<li style="color:#8F008F">At least as old as the tetrapod/coelacanth divergence
<li style="color:#0000FF">At least as old as the amniote/amphibian divergence
<li style="color:#008F8F">At least as old as the mammal/reptile divergence
<li>No minimum age determined
</ul>
