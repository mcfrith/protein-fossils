# Protein fossils

This is a collection of protein fossils: non-protein-coding genome
segments that are descended from protein-coding DNA.  They are
provided as DNA-versus-protein alignments in [psl][] format.  The
`-te` files have protein fossils derived from transposable elements,
and the `-hg` files have protein fossils derived from host genes.
