<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This track shows protein fossils derived from host genes, which are
often called "pseudogenes".  It shows alignments of the genomic DNA to
protein sequences.</p>

<p>Caution: although hits to known protein-coding exons were omitted,
some might be unknown protein-coding exons.</p>
